1. Streamlit yaml now has both deployment and svc. This should work out of the box on DO K8s cluster
2. To get it running on minikube - 
    a. Apply yaml 
    b. run minikube tunnel in a seperate shell which should show external ip on loadbalancer.
    c. run minikube service <name of service> --url -n <namespace>
    d. This is now taking me to Streamlit app, but geting failure from the website it's trying to reach. Might be due to pod debugging.
